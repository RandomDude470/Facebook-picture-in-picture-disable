# Facebook-picture-in-picture-disable
I made a very simple and dumb chrome extension that blocks the annoying floating video (Picture-in-Picture) feature in facebook.com
# How  to use 
Download the folder and go to chrome://extensions and toggle on developer mode and then click "load unpacked" and choose the folder you just downloaded
